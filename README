# C++ CAN Parser

This project provides a C++ library that reads and parses [CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) databases which can then be analyzed for other purposes.

## Compiling the project

Clone the repo on your computer, get into the main directory and run the `make` command:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/xatavian/cpp-can-parser
> cd cpp-can-parser
> make
```

Currently the `main.cpp` does nothing but printing the content of a file into the console.

## Supported standards:
* DBC (in progress)
